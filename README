This is a very simple test of bootstrap and angular using 'connect' server.

Requisites: 
nodejs
connect (node module)
serve-static (node module)

NOTES:

Bootsrap css goes in root folder of whatever view you want to run, in this case ../test.html.

server.js goes in ../nodejs installation folder

run "npm install -g some_module" as root to install modules - global modules should be in usr/lib/node_modules -- not your home user folder unless that's also where you have your view and resources and server and nodejs and node_modules.

the path to whatever view/html file you want to run (in this case usr/lib/angular/test.html) needs to specified in the string you pass to serveStatic(). I made my path absolute for readability.
